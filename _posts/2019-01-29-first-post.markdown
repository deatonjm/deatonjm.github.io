<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I am so excited to be chairing DjangoCon US 2019 this year. I think it will bring a lot of challenges but also a lot of opportunity for personal and professional growth. 

My first initiative as chair is to build out two new teams: Automation and Documenation. 

### Automation

I have noticed over the last two years of organizing this conference that there are a lot of painful processes that can and should be automated. It is something I've discussed at length with other organizers, and yet no one ever takes these projects on. My hope is by organizing a team, getting a good set of ideas about what should be automated, refining our requirements, and recruiting people that want to help the conference succeed but on a more flexible schedule, we will finally see some progress made. 

### Documentation

I have also noticed that we have documenation all over the place, most of which is outdated or difficult to find. We have several amazing writers that have volunteered for DjangoCon for years, and by creating this team, I hope to give them a place to self-organize while bringing visibility (and hopefully improvement) to our current documenation.
