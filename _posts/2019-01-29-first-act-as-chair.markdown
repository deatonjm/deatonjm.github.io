<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I am so excited to be chairing DjangoCon US 2019 this year. I think it will bring a lot of challenges but also a lot of opportunity for personal and professional growth. 

My first initiative as chair is to build out two new teams: Automation and Documentation. To my knowledge, this will be the first time we have tried having teams that are not bound by the conference timeline and that are dedicated to improving the conference organizing experience.

I'm not expecting wild success in this first year, but I am hopeful that this will lead to several contributions that make organzing DjangoCon US less stressful and intimidating for organizers.

### Automation

Over the last two years of organizing this conference, it has become clear that there are a lot of painful processes that can (and should) be automated. It is something I've discussed at length with other organizers, and yet no one ever takes these projects on. Frankly, organizing a conference takes a lot of time and energy. At the end of the conference, no one really has the energy to put into special projects, and understandably so! 

My hope is by creating this team, we can:
* Begin creating a thoughtful list of pain points
* Refine our requirements and identify the minimum product to alleviate those pains
* Recruite people that want to help the conference succeed, but on a more flexible schedule
* Eventually automate!! 

#### Goals for 2019
* Identify what needs to be automated
* Gather feedback from team members about what they need to successfully automate a task
* Decide where scripts and applications will live
* Pilot the automation of a task to identify holes in our expectations, requirements, and processes

#### Expectations for 2019
* A clearer understanding of the feasability of an automation project
* A list of tasks that we can research or build solutions for
* One painful task successfully automated by the start of the 2020 organizing season (more of a stretch goal, but aim high!)

### Documentation

Currently, our conference documenation is all over the place. In the last few years, we have had some tremenous efforts to create documenation, but there isn't a clear organizational structure for it yet. Ideally, we could have documentation that is so well done that a team of completely new organizers could come in and run the show with minimal support from DEFNA or previous organizers. We have several amazing writers that have volunteered for DjangoCon for years, and by creating this team, I hope to give them a place to focus on improving our current documenation.

#### Goals for 2019
* Research organizational strategies to find what best fits our needs
* Gather necessary information to outline team responsibilties, roles, and expectations
* Begin crafting a document to allow for anyone to come in and understand the requirements to put on a conference
* Identify a best practice for letting multiple people work on documentation asynchronously 


#### Expectations for 2019
* Creation and updating of docs outlining the responsibilities and expectations for each team
* A more user friendly organizational strategy
