<h1>Oh, cool, you made it!</h1>

<p>You found my personal website which is forever a work in progress. I try to use it to play around with new technologies and designs when I have time.</p>

<p>Along with several typos, on this site you will find posts about things I'm learning, things I'm trying, things I'm doing poorly, things I'm doing well, things I want to do better, and probably other things. So basically things.</p>

<p>Have questions about organizing a tech conference or want to get involved in organizing DjangoCon US? <a href="mailto:jessicadeaton@outlook.com">Contact me!</a></p>
