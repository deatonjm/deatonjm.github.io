<h1>Oh, cool, you made it!</h1>

<p>You found my personal website which is forever a work in progress and my favorite website to break while trying to teach myself something new. "Why not break a side-project?", you might ask. To which I will reply, "Where's the fun in that?"</p>

<p>Along with several typos, on this site you will find posts about things I'm learning, things I'm trying, things I'm doing poorly, things I'm doing well, things I want to do better, and probably other things. So basically things.</p>
