I am currently a Salesforce developer working in Wilmington, North Carolina. This year, I am chairing DjangoCon US 2019, a national technology conference for the Django web framework. I have also accepted a seat on the Django Software Foundation's board and am acting as their Treasurer.

I love to code, but I also enjoy project management and product ownership. I am familiar with agile practices and scrum, and I like helping teams figure out a flavor of those two ideologies that work best for them. In 2019, I will be looking to obtain a PMP certification as well as a Scrum Master certification.
